    "## Searching the Internet Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people will be familiar with the web interface to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) (and I suspect many more are not aware of the existence of the Internet Archive at all). This provides tools for discovering documents available in the archive, previewing the scanned versions of them, and even searching within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "At times, the search inside a book can be a bit hit and miss, in part depending on the quality of the scanned images and the ability of the OCR tools - where \"OCR\" stands for \"optical character recognition\" - to convert the pictures of text into actual text. Which is to say, *searchable* text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with the archive, we'll use the Python programming language. This lets us write instructions for our machine helpers to follow. One of the machine helpers comes in the form of the [`internetarchive` Python package](https://archive.org/services/docs/api/internetarchive/index.html), a collection of routines that can access the Internet Archive at the programming, rather than human user interface, level.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The human  level interface simply provides graphical tools that we can understand, such as menu items and toolbar buttons. Selecting or clicking these simply invokes machine level commands in a useable-for-us way. Writing program code lets us call those commands directly, in a textual way, rather than visually, by clicking menu items and buttons. Copying and pasting simple text instructions that can be used to perform a particular function is often quite straightforward. Modifying such commands may also be relatively straightforward. (For example, given a block of code that downloads a file from a web location using code of the form `download_file(\"https://example.com/this_file.pdf\")`, you could probably work out how to download a file from `http://another.example.com/myfile.pdf`.) Creating graphical user interfaces is hard. Graphical user interfaces also constrains users to using just the functions and features that the designers and developers of the user interface chose to support in the user interface, in just the way that the user interface allows. Being able to instruct a machine using code, even copied and pasted code, gives the end-use far more power over the machine.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Within any particular programming language, *packages* are often used to bundle together various tools and functions that can be used to support particular activities or tasks, or work with particular resources or resource types.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful tools within the Internet Archive package is the `search_items()` function, which lets us search the Internet Archive."
