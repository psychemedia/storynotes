Your corre- spondent’s memory has a little failed him, as will appear by the following account of the copy now lying before me. It is on a folio leaf, and en- graved throughout. At the top is a large circular plate, representing the Vicar and Moses, not per- forming a funeral, but on their way to the church from the public-house, the sign of the Horse, whence the clerk has been to fetch his master. The inn is seen behind on the left hand, and the church appears on the right, at a formidable distance. The vicar looks very jolly, is dressed in his canoni- cals, and still holds his pipe in his left hand. Mo- ses is a lank figure, wearing a cocked hat and a clerical band, and carries a lantern, with a bit of candle ready to fall out of the socket. Below is the song, the first verse of which is set to musical notes, but the tune is not exactly the usual one sung. The song begins as described in “ N. & Q.”: “ At the sign of the horse,” &c. —\\nand contains sixteen verses.\\nI also possess a copy, but not printed, of the second form of the song, but mine has only thir- teen verses. It is generally superior to the former, and has some very clever and witty verses.

Ave, 5, \\'93.]\\nNOTES AND QUERIES. 117\\n \\nMisuse or Scientiric Terms (8 S. iii. 286,\\n436).—An amusing example of the confusion some- times caused by the use of sphere in its derived sense of ‘‘ province or duty ” occurs to my memory. The late Bishop of Ely, Dr. Woodford, was, like myself, a scholar of Pembroke College, Cambridge. A former master of that college, the once famous Lowndean Professor, Roger Long, celebrated in his day for his mechanical inventiveness and astrono- mical knowledge, constructed a hollow copper\\nsphere representing the celestial firmament, in |\\nwhich the constellations were shown by holes drilled according to their magnitude. It was large enough to stand or sit in, and was made to revolve by a winch. This sphere Dr. Long bequeathed to the college, and left a small sum to be paid annually to an undergraduate to exhibit it when called on. Long’s sphere was a marvel in its day, but when Woodford and I were undergraduates that day was past, and it had been allowed to fall into decay, and was only visited as an old- world curiosity. Now to my story. After Wood- ford had taken his degree and was preparing for Holy Orders, be happened to call on an old clergy- man, who, with reference to his future profession, asked him if he “‘ had got a sphere.” Not at once realizing what the good man meant, and wondering how he could have heard of our Cambridge astro- nomical curiosity, Woodford replied somewhat confusedly, ‘‘ Yes, we have one at Pembroke, but it is rather out of order.” Mutual explanation ensued, which showed that the two were using this word in different but strictly legitimate senses. Epmunp VENABLES.\\nThe use of the word sphere was scientific in early days, and referred to the ancient system of cosmogony, when the universe was conceived as being composed of concentric spheres, on the sur- face of which moved the seven planets and the fixed stars,\\nIt is surely more scientific to assume that “popular errors” were once truths, and to en- deavour to find out what these truths were and to whom they were true, than the reverse.\\nThe quotations from Shakspeare given by Sr. SwitHin are, of course, scientifically correct. See Bartholomew Anglicus, or my little book of extracts from him. Ropvert STEELE.\\nBoth “‘from hence” and “ from thence,” referred | to by Sr. Swirnin on p. 437, are frequently used | in the Bible (A.V.); the latter one also occurs | very often in Shakespeare, but the former only in ‘1 Henry IV.,’ IV. i. 65, and ‘ Lear,’ II. i. 127.\\nG. J.\\n**Sout-cakine” (8 §. iv. 49).—Your corre- spondent will find much information about soul- cakes in Brand’s ‘ Popular Antiquities,’ art, “ All- hallow Even” (ed. Bohn, i. 390, sqq.). This includes a note by Tollett : —\\n“ That on All Saints’ Day, the poor people in Stafford- | shire...... go from parish to parish @ souling, as they call | it, ¢.¢., begging and puling (or singing small, as Bailey\\'s | ‘ Dictionary’ explains puling) for sou/ cakes, or any good | thing to make them merry, This custom is mentioned by Peck, and seems a remnant of Popish superstition to | pray for departed souls, particularly those of friends.” | It is added by the editor :—\\n“The custom of going a Souling still continues in some parte of the county, peasint girls going to farmhouses, singing,— | Soul, soul, for a soul cake,\\nPray you, good mistress, a soul cake.”\\nF,. ADAms,\\nFor soul-cakes in Chester in the year 1878 see |‘ N. & Q.,’5\"S. x. 426. Consult also ‘A Gar- | land for the Year,’ by John Timbs, p. 115; Brand’s ‘Popular Antiquities,’ vol. i. p. 217 (notes to “ All- hallow Eve”); and ‘Clavis Calendaria,’ vol. ii. p. 229 Everarp Home Covemay.\\n71, Brecknock Road,\\n \\n|\\n?\\n| In Austria “Halloween cakes” are still eaten l\\'on November 1; but to my knowledge there |is no special custom in connexion with them. A specimen may no doubt be procured in London at either the Vienna Café in New Oxford Street, or at an Austrian confectioner’s shop towards the Shepherd’s Bush end of High Street, Notting Hill.\\nThe name of the cake is “ Heiligen Stritz’l.” L. L. K.\\nSxopts (8 S. iv. 48).—See ‘ From the Arctic Ocean to the Yellow Sea,’ by Julius M. Price,\\nPp. 44s\\n“Qn September 30 [1890] we passed Selivanaka, a picturesque and flourishing little settlement, which is entirely inhabited by a portion of the secret sect called ‘ Skopti’ or ‘White Doves,’ who are perpetually banished from Russia on account of their peculiar doctrines. I had lately read much about these curious people, and was hoping that we should stop here for wood, so that I should be able to go ashore and have a look round; but we were not in need of fuel, and our time was too precious to allow of any needless delays, so I had to content my- self with as good a look at the settlement, and its in- habitants, as I could get through my binocular, for although a boat containing three men rowed off to us, we did not stop. However we had plenty of opportunity | later on for a closer inspection of these men. It hap- | pened this way: the boat returned to the shore and | Selivanaka was fast disappearing behind us, when we observed another boat rapidly catching us up, coming along close to the shore. In avery short time it was abreast of us, and we then saw it was drawn by three dogs, and contained the same men we had previously seen. They stopped when a little ahead of us, and, taking their dogs on board, rowed off to us and asked us if we would allow them to tow bebind us as far as Turn-\\n \\n| chansk, some few versts further on. The desired permis-\\nsion being given to them, they shortly after came up on deck, and we therefore had plenty of time to examine\\n| more closely these specimens of one of the most curious\\nsects in the world. I was lucky enough to get one of them, who turned out to be the * village elder,’ to let me make a careful sketch of him, as he had a face full of\\ncharacter; during which time I managed, through an'"

       "“Some of my readers will feel disposed to laugh out- right at a learned doctor admitting he is an inveterate believer in all sorts of popular superstitions, forebodings, and presentiments. I am alarmed at the spilling of a salt-cellar; I don’t like to meet a hearse while going out of the street door ; I would not undertake a journey or any important work on a Friday; and the breaking of a looking-glass would throw me into fits. Now this morn- ing,* soon after our téte-d-téte déjeiiner, I became sud- denly depressed in spirits, to such a degree that my fair hostess fancied I had been taken ill. This state of nervousness and depression endured after I had retired to my hotel, and was making ready my luggage for my positive departure at noon on the succeeding day, leaving out only the evening dress for the dinner and opera. On taking my place at dinner the knife and fork laid before me crossway startled me (I dare say I turned pale), but I said nothing. There were two attendants. At the next course the other valet replaced my plate, and again the fatal cross was laid before me! I looked round to the three guests to see if it was the habit of the servants of the house; they had no cross, only the doctor : and again the third time the same symbol made its appearance before me with the setting of the dessert and corresponding plates with gilt knife and fork, the two latter “of whi ch articles again contrived to be laid down in a crucial form. Ah! now there was no mistake. Some great crossing was about to befall me. I had bet- ter shut myself up for the rest of the day, give up the proposed drive and the opera, and wait until I can escape in the morning from the doomed city. To make matters still more formidable, I found, on looking at my calendar, that it was Friday. All this mind-work I of course kept to myself, albeit I must have appeared rather more stupid than was my wont.”—Vol. i. p. 413,\n",

A friend of Talleyrand, courteous and obliging in private life, parfait gentilhomme, but doggedly resolved upon keeping the Foreign Office papers unsullied by the hands of historical stu- dents, he would have deemed the communication of the treaty between Karl the Bald and Ludwig the German fraught with danger to the state. It was during Count d’Hauterive’s administration that Lemontey and Sir James Mackintosh obtained permission to make transcripts from the documents preserved in the Dépét des Relations Extérieures, the former for the history of the reign of Louis XV., the latter for his account of the Revolution of 1688. The dragon who watched with such jealous care the diplomatic garden of the Hesperides was obliged to yield ; but, if he could not wreak his vengeance upon the English statesman, he made, at any rate, Lemontey’s heirs smart for it.

But I must forbear, and remain satisfied with alluding to the controversy which broke out between him and M. Victor Cousin on the subject of Pascal's Pensées, the latter not only maintaining that the austere Port-Royalist was in love, but trying to find out what lady had succeeded in winning his affec- tion; the former indignantly protesting against the cynicism which transformed Pascal into a kind of inamorato. These literary debates, however, have nothing to do with M. Faugére’s fitness for his post as Keeper of the Archives at the French Foreign Office. It would be impossible to imagine a better choice in ev rery respect ; and the ghost of poor D’Hauterive must feel dismayed indeed at the prospect of the liberal reforms which the Duke Decazes, supported by his able coadjutor, has sanctioned.

Fisnwick and I may be speaking of two different persons ; but, notwithstanding a serious discrepancy in the date of death, I suspect —from coincidence in date of birth, and of appoint- ment to a Lancashire living (Garstang), and identity of college and name of father, and some resemblance in sound between Warwick and Warrington—that he refers to the Rev. Thomas Hayward, one of the head masters of Boteler’s Free Grammar School at Warrington, of whom an account will be found in vol. viii., p. 69, of the Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, in a paper by me on the subject of that Foundation. I may add to the information there given, which is too lengthy for transfer to your columns, that his father, Thomas Hayward, who was an attorney at Warrington, was baptized at the parochial chapel of Daresbury, Cheshire, a few miles from Warrington ; he is stated in the register to have been the son of George Hayward, of Keiquicke (one of the many ways of spelling Keckwick, a township in that chapelry), and to have been born July 23, 1655.

My object in referring to the sub- ject here is to hope that the same thing may be done in every county, and that the collections may include writings in various dialects, lists of locally- printed books (many of which never reach Blooms- bury), of all the works, small as well as great, relating to the county, of local worthies, and of authors, celebrated and comparatively unknown, born within the county. As copies of all our newspapers are preserved at the British Museum, the collections would soon prove of great value to the antiquary, and a thousand waifs and strays, that would not find admission even to the pages of “N. & Q.,” be preserved. The schoolmaster who laughs at old traditions, and the railway that is rapidly mixing the population of the country, are sad destroyers of our local legends. Who, then,\n",

       "The book would probably have been long since forgotten, had it not been for the fact of its being mentioned by Boswell in his Life of Johnson :—\n",
       "“ This season (1778) there was a whimsical fashion in the newspapers (qy. did these characters appear in more than one!) of applying Shakspeare’s words to describe living persons well known in the world, which was done under the title of Modern Characters from Shakspeare, many of which were admirably adapted. The fancy took so much that they were afterwards collected into a pamphlet. Somebody said to Johnson, across the table, that he had not been in these characters. ‘ Yes,’ said he, ‘I have; I should have been sorry to have been left out.’ He then repeated what had been applied to him :—\n",
       "‘ You must borrow me Garagantua’s mouth.’ Miss Reynolds not perceiving at once the meaning, he was obliged to explain it to her, which had something of an awkward and ludicrous effect : ‘Why, madam, it has reference to me as using big words, which require the mouth of a giant to pronounce them. Garagantua is the name of a giant in Rabelais.’”\n",

       "“ You must borrow me Garagantua’s mouth,\n",
       "Tis a word too great for any mouth of this age’s size.’ If I remember rightly, it has been shown in these pages that Garaganta, not Garagantua, is the proper reading.\n",

Some six or seven years ago a Birming- ham newspaper (I forget which) began to collect old lore. This was followed by a Chesterfield paper, The Derbyshire Times, which, under the special editorship of a well-known contributor to “N. & Q.,” published weekly for several years from one to three cols. of valuable and interesting matter, under the heading of “ Local Notes and Queries.” This form of “news” was soon imitated by neighbouring papers, with pretty fair success on the whole. Amongst the papers which con- tinue to collect from their readers under this head- ing I may name the Manchester Guardian, the Sheffield and Rotherham Independent, the Brad- ford Observer, and three Derby papers—the Reporter, Advertiser, and Mercury. Several Che- shire newspapers publish antiquarian notes, and the North of England Advertiser a short time ago made this kind of reading a principal feature in its weekly issue. Tomas RatcLiFrFrE.\n",

       "of this constellation from northern latitudes is to be found in the precession of the equinoxes, or the slight receding westward of the points where the ecliptic or sun’s path crosses the equator twice a year. Owing to the greater thickness of the earth at the equator, that part of the earth comes to the equinoctial points a little sooner ; consequently the sun appears to recede or go back towards the west, and the North Pole moves every year a little back- ward on the circle it describes in the northern sky. This movement being about 50” of a degree yearly, the relative place of the stars in ancient times can be ascertained by it. The North Pole makes this circle in about 25,900 years. The North Polar star of to-day has not always been nor will it continue to be the Pole star. At the time of the construc- tion of the earliest catalogues of the stars, 120 z.c., it was 12° from the Pole, it is now only 1° 24’ ; it will continue to approach to within half a degree, and will then recede. At the time of the erection of the great Pyramid of Gizeh, some 4,000 years ago, the pole of the heavens was near Alpha Draconis. It is a curious fact that of the nine pyramids, six of the largest had the narrow entrance passages inclined downwards at such an angle that the Pole star of that time must have been visible, perhaps in daylight. In about 12,000 years the bright star Vega or Alpha Lyre will cose the Pole star. As regards the Star of Bethlehem, the star that guided the Wise Men, it is a matter of history that about 125 years B.c. a bright star appeared, and gradually increased in brilliancy, so as to be seen in the daytime about the time of our Saviour ; it gradually decreased in brightness and disappeared. It was the appear- ance of this star that induced Hipparchus to draw up his catalogue. It was situated in the constella- tion Coma or Koma, not far from Virgo. Its great peculiarity would be that its appearance had been predicted some 1,400 years before. From its position it would culminate, or be on the meridian about twelve at night, in the latitude of Jerusalem.\n",

As one who suggested upwards of thirty years ago the advisability of collecting the remains of our popular mythology and superstitions before they were quite trampled out by the iron horse, and who has never ceased to take an interest in the subject, I venture to say that not a day should be lost in organizing such a society. A central committee in London, of some half dozen who have made Folk-Lore more or less a study, with local secretaries in different parts of the country, if backed by a couple of hundred subscribers of a guinea, might collect and print an interesting yearly volume.\n",
       "Judging from what I have seen in some local newspapers, one of the committee’s greatest diffi- culties would be not that of collecting, but that of selecting what is not already recorded by Brand and his editors, Sir Henry Eliis and Mr. Halliwell- Phillipps. This would require to be done with considerable judgment, and with great care, so as not to discourage those who take the trouble to communicate what they believe to be not generally known.\n",

       "I concur with several correspondents of “N. & Q.” that no time should be allowed to be lost in establishing this society. A special department might be constituted for the collection and recording of Celtic folk-lore, the superstitious beliefs and practices and the other popular lore of Ireland, Wales, the Scottish Highlands, and Man, —items which are interesting from their distinctive character, and the more urgently in need of pre- servation because associated in most cases with perishing vernacular tongues. In connexion with the useful list given by Mr. Rarciirre, and con- tinued by others, it may be mentioned that several Highland publications devote space to the subject of folk-lore, e.g. the Inverness Courier, the High- lander, and the Celtic Magazine (Inverness, A. & W. Mackenzie) ; and that the Gaelic Society of Inverness have appointed a folk-lore committee. Some interesting contributions to the subject were contained in the Gaidheal, a magazine published by Messrs. Nicolson, of Glasgow. It is now, I fear, extinct, and as I have received no reply to a communication addressed to the publishers, I pre- sume certain back numbers which I require cannot be supplied by them.

       "Welsh folk-lore finds a home in the columns of the Oswestry Advertiser (from which it is reprinted as “ Bye-gones relating to Wales and the Border Counties”), in the Cambrian News, and, I believe, in other newspapers of the Principality. It is sig- nificant, as an illustration of the position occupied at present by Ireland as regards matters literary, that that country—so singularly rich in monuments of the past of every description, whether in the ruins and ancient remains meeting the traveller on all hands or in the beliefs and usages which have come down from a period beyond history —has not, so far as Iam aware, a single newspaper or other weekly or daily publication which concerns itself Apart from any other consi- deration, it seems strange that the managers of Irish newspapers do not recognize the increased interest which they would lend to their respective journals, and the possibility of increased circula- tion, by opening a folk-lore column.\n",

It would appear more advisable to classify according to subject (“ Days and Sea- sons,” “Spells and Charms,” &c.), and to issue in fasciculi, with a continuous pagination, notes under each heading, duly labelled, in Mr. Skeat’s phrase, “after the manner of the mineralogist, with the place of collection,” leaving further classification to very full synoptical indexes.

Many years ago I heard it sung with spirit and grave mirthfulness by Mr. Fraser, of the Scottish Society of Antiquaries, whose property it virtually became by right of conquest, in Edinburgh. It is not improbably an old convivial song, but I never saw it in print earlier than the date of Mrs. Gordon’s memoir of Christopher North, published by Messrs. Edmon- ston & Douglas, in 1862. She received the words and music of the song (which had delighted Pro- fessor Wilson) from her friend P. S. Fraser.

About and about, And about went he, Until he came up with the French Gallee. Oh ! some were playing cards, And some were playing dice ; When he took out an Instrument, bored thirty holes at twice ! Then some they ran with cloaks, with caps, To try if they could stap the saut-water draps. ¢ About and about, And about went he, Until he cam back to the Goulden Vanitee. * Now throw me o'er a rope, And pu’ me on buird ; And prove unto me as guid as your word.’ ‘We'll no throw you o’er a rope, Nor pu’ you on buird, Nor prove unto you as guid as our word.’ Out spoke the little Cabin-boy, Out spoke he, ‘Then hang me /°Ul sink ye as I sunk the Gallee.’ But they ve thrown him o'er a rope, And have pu'd him up on buird ; And have proved unto him far better than their word: As they sailed by the Lowlands low.” Whosoever may have been the author of the ditty, he knew well the ingratitude of a nation to its benefactors and defenders, and certainly antici- pated the power and efficacy of our Naval Steam Rams. If they are only as destructive to the enemy as they seem inclined to be to our own seamen, there will be something gained for the outlay :-— “ Por it showed what a very fine Ram she was, Said the Ad-mi-ral-i-tee.’ The author of “The Goulden Vanitee” remains unknown (Memoir of John Wilson, ii. 317) ; but, it is to be hoped, further information m: ay be gained.

       "One Year in Sweden (1862) mentions the Skene of Rubislaw who was enrolled amongst the Swedish noblesse, his nobility as an armiger having been acknowledged. The appendix to that work con- tains a list (more or less correct) of “Scotch Nobles” (of Sweden), titled and untitled ; in the former class, I presume, Mr. Skene included him- self, as I suppose the expression “ take his seat among the Swedish nobility” is equivalent to ours of “a seat in the Lords.” In Sweden, as in Ger- many, titles, I believe, descend to ali the heirs male ; therefore are not the Lords of the Swedish Parliament the heads of the titled families ?

       "Robert Blakiston, of Bishop Wearmouth, co, Durham, living in 1821, when Surtees compiled his pedigree, was a descendant from Marmaduke Blakiston, the founder of the Newton Hall (Durham) and Old Malton (Yorkshire) branches of the Blakistons. Surtees places this Marma- duke as fifth son of John Blakiston, Esq., of Blakiston (co. Durham), and not third, as alleged by Mr. Jonnson Batty (5\" S. v. 216). This Marmaduke was one of a family of sixteen (ten and six daughters). Robert Blakiston married Margaret Cass at Bishop Wearmouth, Nov. 1, 1785, living in 1821. They had issue— William, bap. 1789; James, bap. 1790 ; Robert, bap. 1793 ; Mary, bap. 1787 ; Eleanor, bap. 1792 (died unmarried in 1810) [perhaps some corre- spondents can supply me with the names of the descendants of the first four children, with dates, &c.]. Margaret Tempest Blakiston, another of Robert Blakiston’s children, bap. May 26, 1795, married the Rev. James Dunn, B.D., Rector of Preston, Suffolk, and had issue John Dunn, Esq., of Kirby Lodge, whose eldest daughter, Florence Blakiston Dunn, was married on June 29, 1876, at Little Shelford, Cambridge, to William Donkin, Esq., Oxford. Anne Tempest Blakiston, another daughter of Robert Blakiston, was born June 18, 1796 (qy. if ever married?). Harriet Tempest Blakiston, another daughter of Robert Blakiston, was born Feb. 28, 1799 ; married, first, Alexander Renney, merchant, of Riga, in Russia, by whom she had a daughter, Juliana Margaret Renney (married to Dr. Anderson, C.B., of Sunnybrae, Pitlochry, Perthshire), and a son, G. A. Renney, Lieut.-Col. R. Horse Artillery. Harriet Tempest Blakiston’s second husband was Thomas Gray, Esq., of Sunderland, by whom she had a large family. 8. F. Lonestarre, F.R.H.S.\n",

       "Those only who know the fascination which the subject of popular antiquities, superstitions, and traditions has had for me from the time I read Sir Francis Palgrave’s learned and amusing articles upon it in the Quarterly Review, and Sir Walter Seott’s charming essay on fairy mythology, in his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, more than fifty years ago, can understand the pleasure with which I read, in “N. & Q.” of Feb. 12, 1876, Sr. Switnin’s happy suggestion of a folk-lore society. From causes with which it would be an imperti- nence to trouble your readers, I was unable to do more than wish the proposal God-speed, which I did in “N. & Q.” of July 1 following, in a short paper signed An Orv Forx-Lorist, which con- tained sufficient indications as to who the writer was ; at all events I believe, from the manner in which Sr. Swirnty (vi. 91) paid me the compli- ment of suggesting I should play grandfather to the bantling of my own offspring, “ N. & Q.,” that there was at least one who recognized me.\n",
       "Nothing but the reasons to which I have just |\n",
       "referred prevented my responding to so flattering aM invitation, and placing the experience in the management of such a society which I had acquired during my thirty-four years’ connexion with the first of all such societies, the Camden, at the ser- Vice of the folk-lore loving public.\n",
       " \n",
       "But non sum qualis eram. My readiness to work in so good a cause is not backed by an equal ability ; and I fear a correspondence I have had with Sr. Swirnry, hampered as it was by the conflict between my will and my ability, has done more harm than good by putting off its formation ; and it is by way of apology for this unintentional hindrance, and to promote the good work, that I venture to trouble you with my ideas as to how that good work may be most effectually accomplished.\n",
       "There are two points on which my opinion is unchanged :—\n",
       "1. That the headquarters of the society must be in London.\n",
       "2. That the subscription must be 11. a year.\n",
       "I insist on the first point because the Folk-Lore Society must not only have a local habitation and a name, but that habitation must be central and permanent. For, unlike the vrinting societies, the books of which are circuleted and dispersed, the few remainders being stored at the printers’, the Folk-Lore Society will be a society to collect and store a vast amount of curious, out-of-the-way, old-wives’ lore. One of its most important duties will be to gather in the various local journals which indulge in folk-lore columns, and to mount and preserve those columns for future use. I will not now stop to suggest the very simple mode in which I think this may be accomplished.\n",
       "Do not let it be supposed, from my insisting on London as a centre, that I undervalue the import- ance of local co-operation. How much the success of the Camden Society was owing to the intro duction of local secretaries (which, if I remember rightly, arose from a suggestion of Dr. Bliss, who became local secretary for Oxford) a glance at the first annual list of members would show ; while the Society of Antiquaries, which some years afterwards followed the example of the Camden Society, has now upwards of seventy gentlemen, many of the highest rank, who act as local secre taries to that learned body.\n",
       "I insist upon the subscription being 17. because I foresee that, from the nature of the society, the incidental expenses, apart from the paper and printing, must be large ; and paper and print ar luxuries which must be paid for.\n",
       "Next to the gathering together the relics of our own folk-lore, and eventually the analogous folk lore of other countries, the printing and circulation of the more important items will be the chief object of the society.\n",
       "There would, on the one hand, be great economy in confining this to the publication of an annua! volume.\n",
       "On the other, though there are obvious objec tions besides that of increased expense, there would probably be some compensating advantages by smaller and more frequent issues, something like the Zeitschrift fiir deutsche Mythologieund Sittenkunde,\n",
