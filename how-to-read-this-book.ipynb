    "In many stories, the words used to represent a spell may look like a made up nonsense that make no sense to you, the teller, let alone the audience. It can be the same with programming code. If the code in this book makes no sense to you, the reader of this text, don't worry. You should still come away with a sense of the sorts of things we can ask a computer to do, as well the sorts of things it will do in response to our commands.\n",

It's the same with code: amidst the cryptic commands, you will often be able to recognise certain words or elements in there, and from that make some sort of sense about what is being manipulated, and possibly how. The address of a web page, for example, which is to say, a \"URL\". Or a search term that forms part of a query: _\"wazza wayza oono wayza 'the golden palace'\"_.\n",

    "## Stories Not Theatre\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you may be wondering *why* there is such a focus on code to work with story data sources. Why should I put you through all this pain rather than just making a website that makes that lets you search through various story collections using a simple web based search form. And why is there a reliance on making cryptic search queries rather than just letting you enter words in a search box.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's because user interfaces are hard to produce, hard to maintain, hard to get right, and often limiting in what they allow the user to do. They also need hosting somewhere (which costs money, and time to set up). And securing against attack (because people are forever trying to take over other peoples' computers so they can use them to attack yet other people, or hijack them to mine for that cryptic treasure known as bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as user interfaces go, the designer always has to make certain decisions about what they think the user is likely to want to do. Someone else then typically makes various decisions about how to support that behaviour, decisions that lead to a particular user interface and system architecture. And then someone else — the programmer, the developer — has to find a way to implement the outcome of those decisions in code. And someone else has to make it look pretty and easy to use on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "By sticking with code, we are focusing on the bare bones of the story. This is not theatre. We don't have the set designers making the user interface and the teams of people interpreting the story so that it can be told in a theatrical way. We're just trying to get the basic story sorted out, in its rawest of forms."

    "## Some Tricks to Help You Recognise Code Tropes and Archetypes\n",
    "\n",
    "When telling a folk tale or a fairy tale from a particular tradition, we rely on tropes and archetypes. In Germanic fairy tales, the evil witch who lives in the forest, the trolls and giants of Scandinavian tales, the dragon-serpents of Eastern and Eastern European fairy tales, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a story, we invoke archetypes we can rely on to perform certain  certain roles:\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we situate the king:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Once, __in a land far far away__, there was an evil king...*\n",
    "\n",
    "All these techniques allow us to invoke, and draw on, a folk memory of certain expectations and beliefs about what a particular character is like, how it will behave, and what sorts of things we might imagine it to do, even if we are never explictly told about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "*In a far off land, was a king, an evil king...*\n",
    "\n",
    "As storyteller, we use such constructions to invoke a character that we can use in the rest of the story. We can be reasonably confident that we don't need to go into a lot of detail, nor a long and complicated back story, to make sure that the audience knows what sort of character the king is.\n",
    "\n",
    "They just know. Through the work of other stories and storytellers, and other tales told many times before. And we can tap directly into that knowledge and just get on with the story.\n",

And this means that we can quite quickly create what seem to be impossibly complex tales, pretty much off the top of our heads, using our own, made up, recipes, and some perhaps not-so-simple bundles of code developed incrementally by hundreds of other story-coders over tens of years.\n",
