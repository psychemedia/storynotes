    "# Invoking the Incantations Contained in This Book\n",
    "\n",
    "The role the code incantations play in this book takes various forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the incantations are used to produce various treasures, assets and databases used in other parts of the book. Secondly, the incantations demonstrate how to work with the magical things we have created. Thirdly, the incantations itself form part of the story, explaining how we can come to create our own tools as we construct them, much like a blacksmith creates their own tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "As suggested in the previous chapter, some of the incantations are made up and constructed anew, whilst others, often very powerful, third party spells and incantations, are shamelessly borrowed and reused. (As in the world of story, so in the world of code...)\n",
    "\n",
    "At times, gaining access to some of these third party packages can be...*somewhat complicated*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not because the scripts aren't readily available. Far from it... But rather because they sometimes take a quite a lot of setting up...\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the challenges that keep getting set by a King who really doesn't want the tinker to marry his daughter, no matter how resourceful or capable the tinker appears to be: just when you think you've done everything you've needed, there's always just \"one more thing\" to do..."
