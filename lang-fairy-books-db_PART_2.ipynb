    "## Finding Book Index-Like Things In Lang's Fairy Stories...\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems associated with *search* as a form of discovery is knowing what to search for. If you have a traditional print book, it contains various navigational clues that let you quickly get a sense of what the book contains, and in what order.\n",
    "\n",
    "A look at the table of contents gives you great big signposts in the form of chapter headings, and the distance from one signpost to the net is given not in leagues or miles, but pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the back of the book, the index provides a jewellery box of trinkets, each with its own story, or stories, to tell, at a signposted location inside the book. Skimming the index gives you a summary of the key players and key topics contained inside the book: the indexer is truly of the cunning kind. A large index entry suggests the important role the perosn, or place, or topic so indexed, plays within the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for our fairy tales, if we aren't sure *what* to search for in order to discover, can we create an index like thing that will tell us what the key nouns are – the names, places and events – and perhaps other key references, such as to large sums of money mentioned somewhere within the tales?\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as the precious objects worthy of mention, there are other things we can tease out of the text that might make it easier to search for what we want. For example, if we want to find a story that explicitly mentions a large financial reward, it might be useful if we could search for tales mentioning at least 500 gold pieces (or equivalent). But how could we possibly do that, you might ask...\n",
    "\n",
    "In *technicalese*, by extracting entities we can search around, that's how... And I don't necessarily mean \"entities\" of the supernatural kind, the bogles and boggarts and other things that come out at night that we might generically class as _\"ghouls\"_.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what sorts of *entity* might we be able to find in the stories...?!"
